# Substrate Risc0
This repository contains an example Substrate chain I'm using to explore my curiosity on the potential of zero knowledge proof verification on-chain. Specifically, the chain contains a pallet which knows how to verify `Receipts` from Risc0 programs.

This might be a good starting point for those looking to experiment with Risc0 verification on Substrate chains.

## Status
This code may be a bit out-of-date for both Substrate and RISC Zero. For a more up-to-date example, see https://github.com/justinfrevert/Project-TOEP.

## Getting started with Risc0
See [this tutorial](https://www.risczero.com/docs/examples/hello_multiply) for an introduction to the prover and verifier used here.

## Prover
The host cost runs the existing "factors" example from Risc0. This component uses [Subxt](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt) to send transactions to the chain.
Current examples:
- factors(risc0 hello world)
- wasm(No tx send or matching pallet, yet)

To run the prover: 
[Start the local node](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template#getting-started), then:
```shell
cd provers/factors
cargo run
```

## Verifier
The pallet serves as the verifier, using the [risc0-zkvm ](https://docs.rs/risc0-zkvm/latest/risc0_zkvm/). This was derived from the Substrate template, so the pallet still shares the name of the boilerplate [template pallet](https://github.com/justinFrevert/substrate-risc0/tree/main/pallets/template)

## Substrate and local development
If unfamiliar with Substrate and how to run Substrate-based nodes, please see the [Substrate Node Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template), as the steps are the same.
